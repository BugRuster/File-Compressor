# Installation

To use this script, you'll need to have Python 3 installed on your machine. You can download and install it from the official Python website.

You'll also need to install a few Python packages. You can do that by running the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Usage

To compress a file using Huffman encoding, you can run the compress.py script from your terminal by passing in the path to the file you want to compress and the desired name for the compressed file:

```
python compress.py path/to/input/file path/to/output/file
```

To decompress a file, you can run the decompress.py script by passing in the path to the compressed file and the desired name for the decompressed file:

```
python decompress.py path/to/compressed/file path/to/output/file
```
Alternatively, you can use the GUI by running the gui.py script:

```
python gui.py
```
The GUI will open and you'll be able to select the input file, the output file, and whether you want to compress or decompress the file.
